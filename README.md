# Jellyfin RAR Archive Reader Plugin

A Jellyfin plugin that enables playback of media files stored inside RAR archives without manual extraction.

> **Alpha Software** - This plugin is in early development. Back up your media libraries and Jellyfin configuration before installing.

## Features

- **Transparent RAR access**: Play video/audio files directly from RAR archives
- **STRM streaming**: Creates `.strm` files that stream media from RAR archives on demand
- **Auto-discovery**: Reads library paths from Jellyfin configuration
- **Multi-part archive support**: Handles `.rar`, `.r00`, `.r01`, and `.partX.rar` naming conventions
- **Auto-update**: Automatically updates `.strm` files when RAR archives are moved
- **Orphan cleanup**: Removes `.strm` files when their RAR archives are deleted
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Windows and Linux (Docker)

## Requirements

- **Jellyfin**: 10.11.x or 12.x, Windows or Linux (tested with linuxserver/jellyfin Docker)
- **No additional dependencies**: Uses built-in STRM file streaming

A single `dotnet build` produces an assembly for each supported server version.
Install the one matching your Jellyfin:

| Your Jellyfin | Install from | Built against |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 10.11.x       | `bin/Release/net9.0/`  | Jellyfin 10.11.4 |
| 12.x          | `bin/Release/net10.0/` | Jellyfin 12.0.0  |

The two builds share identical source — only the referenced Jellyfin assemblies
and target framework differ. A net10.0 assembly will **not** load on Jellyfin
10.11.x, so pick the right one.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the plugin files

Download or build these files:
- `Jellyfin.Plugin.RarArchiveReader.dll`
- `SharpCompress.dll`

To build from source:
```bash
dotnet build -c Release
# Output: bin/Release/net9.0/  (Jellyfin 10.11.x)
#         bin/Release/net10.0/ (Jellyfin 12.x)
```

### Step 2: Copy files to the plugin directory

**Windows:**
```
C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\RarArchiveReader\Jellyfin.Plugin.RarArchiveReader.dll
C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\RarArchiveReader\SharpCompress.dll
```

**Linux (Docker):**
```bash
# Find your Jellyfin config path:
docker inspect jellyfin --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{if eq .Destination "/config"}}{{.Source}}{{end}}{{end}}'

# Copy the DLLs:
mkdir -p /path/to/jellyfin/config/data/plugins/RarArchiveReader
cp Jellyfin.Plugin.RarArchiveReader.dll /path/to/jellyfin/config/data/plugins/RarArchiveReader/
cp SharpCompress.dll /path/to/jellyfin/config/data/plugins/RarArchiveReader/
chown -R 1000:100 /path/to/jellyfin/config/data/plugins/RarArchiveReader
```

Or use the installer script:
```bash
bash install.sh /path/to/jellyfin/config
```

### Step 3: Restart Jellyfin

Stop and start Jellyfin for the plugin to load.

### Step 4: Organize your media

Jellyfin uses folder names to identify TV shows. Your RAR files must be in a folder named after the show:

```
TV Shows/
  Show Name (Year)/
    showname.s01e01.rar
    showname.s01e01.r00
    showname.s01e01.r01
```

### Step 5: Scan your library

1. Go to Jellyfin Dashboard > Libraries
2. Click on your TV Shows library > Scan Library

The plugin will:
1. Find all RAR archives in your library
2. Extract the list of media files inside each archive
3. Create `.strm` files that point to the streaming endpoint

## How It Works

1. **During any library scan**, the plugin hooks into Jellyfin's item resolver:
   - Every folder Jellyfin looks at is checked for a first RAR volume (`.rar`, `.part1.rar`, `.part01.rar`)
   - The archive is opened and its media files are listed
   - `.strm` files are written next to the RAR **and handed to Jellyfin in the same pass**, so the
     movie/episode appears immediately - no second scan needed
   - This works for "Scan All Libraries", a single-library scan **and** the real-time library
     monitor refresh that fires when a new release folder appears (enable *Real time monitoring*
     on the library to get the latter)

   Two safety nets run as well:
   - **Process RAR Archives** scheduled task (on startup and every 6 hours) sweeps all library paths
   - A **post-scan task** runs after "Scan All Libraries" and also prunes orphaned `.strm` files and stale DB items

   Both ask Jellyfin in-process to refresh only the folders that received new `.strm` files.

2. **STRM file contents:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8096/RarStream/{encoded-archive-path}/{encoded-entry-path}
   ```

3. **On playback**, Jellyfin:
   - Reads the `.strm` file to get the streaming URL
   - Requests the media from the plugin's `/RarStream` endpoint
   - The plugin extracts and streams the file directly from the RAR

4. **Result:**
   ```
   TV Shows/SuperKitties (2022)/
     superkitties.s02e01.rar         <- Original RAR archive
     superkitties.s02e01.r00         <- Additional RAR parts
     superkitties.s02e01.r01
     SuperKitties.S02E01.strm        <- Created by plugin (points to streaming URL)
   ```

5. **Auto-update feature:**
   - If you move RAR files to a different folder, just rescan the library
   - The plugin automatically updates `.strm` files with the new paths
   - Orphaned `.strm` files (pointing to deleted RARs) are cleaned up

## Configuration

Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Plugins** > **RAR Archive Reader**:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Enable automatic scanning | Auto-detect RAR archives during library scans | Enabled |
| Maximum file size (MB) | Max size for fallback streaming | 500 |
| Cache archive metadata | Cache file list for faster access | Enabled |
| Supported video extensions | Video file types to recognize | `.mkv,.mp4,.avi,...` |
| Supported audio extensions | Audio file types to recognize | `.mp3,.flac,.wav,...` |
| Supported image extensions | Image file types to recognize | `.jpg,.png,.gif,...` |

## Troubleshooting

### Show appears as "Programme" with 0 episodes

This happens when Jellyfin can't identify the show from the folder name.

**Fix:** Rename the folder to match the actual show name:
```
D:\kitties\              <- BAD: "kitties" not recognized
D:\SuperKitties (2022)\  <- GOOD: matches show in TVDB/TMDB
```

After renaming, rescan the library.

### Playback loads forever then fails

1. **Check the `.strm` file path:** Open the `.strm` file in a text editor. The URL should point to the current location of your RAR file.

2. **Verify the endpoint works:** Open the URL from the `.strm` file in your browser. You should get a file download.

3. **Rescan the library:** If you moved the RAR files, rescan the library to update the `.strm` files automatically.

### No `.strm` files created

1. Check that the RAR archive contains supported video files (`.mkv`, `.mp4`, etc.)
2. Verify the plugin is enabled in Dashboard > Plugins
3. Check Jellyfin logs for errors

### Permission denied (Linux)

Ensure the Jellyfin user can read your media directories:
```bash
chown -R 1000:100 /path/to/media
```

## Advanced: Standalone Scripts

Optional utility scripts are available in the `scripts/` folder. See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for details.

## Limitations

- **Folder naming matters**: The parent folder of RAR files must match the show name for Jellyfin to identify it
- **Hardcoded port**: `.strm` files use `localhost:8096` - if Jellyfin runs on a different port, playback won't work
- **Seeking may be slow**: Seeking in large files requires re-reading from the archive start
- **No encrypted archives**: Password-protected RARs not supported

## Building from Source

```bash
# Prerequisites: .NET 9.0 and .NET 10.0 SDKs (the project multi-targets)
dotnet build -c Release

# Output: bin/Release/net9.0/  (Jellyfin 10.11.x)
#         bin/Release/net10.0/ (Jellyfin 12.x)

# To build only one:
dotnet build -c Release -f net9.0
```

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test tests/Jellyfin.Plugin.RarArchiveReader.Tests
```

Regression coverage runs against committed RAR fixtures spanning the format
matrix — RAR4 and RAR5, stored and compressed, single and multi-volume, and both
volume naming schemes:

| Fixture | Format | Method | Volumes |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| `rar4-store-single`  | RAR4 | stored     | 1 (`.rar`) |
| `rar4-store-multi`   | RAR4 | stored     | 7 (`.partN.rar`) |
| `rar4-store-oldvol`  | RAR4 | stored     | 7 (`.rar` + `.rNN`) |
| `rar4-comp-multi`    | RAR4 | compressed | 2 |
| `rar5-store-multi`   | RAR5 | stored     | 7 |
| `rar5-comp-single`   | RAR5 | compressed | 1 |
| `rar5-comp-multi`    | RAR5 | compressed | 2 |
| `rar5-comp-m3-multi` | RAR5 | `m3`       | 2 |

For each format the tests assert that entries are listed with correct sizes,
that extracted bytes are SHA-256 identical to the source payloads, and — the
important one — that **direct stored access engages for stored entries and is
refused for compressed ones**. A silent fall back to sequential reads is what
made seeking unusable on large archives, so it is asserted rather than assumed.
Stored archives additionally get random-access reads at offsets straddling
volume seams and at the tail; compressed archives exercise the
`RarBufferedStream` fallback including a backward seek.

Fixtures are regenerated with `tests/fixtures/generate-fixtures.sh`, which needs
RARLab's `rar` CLI (7-Zip and unrar can read RAR but cannot create it).

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **RarArchiveResolver**: Item resolver that creates STRM files while Jellyfin scans (any scan type) and injects them into the current pass
- **RarArchiveStartupTask / RarArchivePostScanTask**: Scheduled / post-scan sweeps of all library paths
- **StrmFileHelper**: Shared STRM creation logic used by all three entry points
- **RarStreamController**: HTTP endpoint that streams media from RAR archives
- **RarFileSystem**: Virtual filesystem for archive reading
- **RarArchiveReader**: SharpCompress-based archive reader
- **RarBufferedStream / RarMediaStreamProvider**: Buffered streaming for playback

### Library Path Discovery

The plugin reads Jellyfin's library configuration from:
- `/config/data/root/default/*/options.xml` (linuxserver container)
- `/var/lib/jellyfin/root/default/*/options.xml` (native Linux install)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\jellyfin\root\default\*\options.xml` (Windows portable)
- `%PROGRAMDATA%\Jellyfin\Server\root\default\*\options.xml` (Windows standard)

## Changelog

### 3.1.0

- Supports **both Jellyfin 10.11.x and 12.x** from one source tree via multi-targeting: the `net9.0` build references Jellyfin 10.11.4, the `net10.0` build references 12.0.0
- No `#if` conditionals were needed — every API the plugin uses is unchanged between the two server versions

### 3.0.0

- Target **Jellyfin 12.0** and **net10.0**. Requires Jellyfin 12.0 or newer — for 10.11.x servers build the `v2.2.1-jellyfin10.11` tag
- No source changes were needed: the resolver, post-scan, scheduled-task and middleware APIs the plugin uses are unchanged in Jellyfin 12
- Corrected `build.yaml`, which still declared version 1.0.0.0, ABI 10.9.0.0, net8.0 and the long-removed rar2fs mounting
- SharpCompress stays pinned at 0.44.0 — the seekable stored-entry path reflects into its internals and needs testing before a bump

### 2.2.1

- Inject `ILoggerFactory` into the plugin so `RarFileSystem` log messages (idle reader eviction, volume-set change reopens) reach the log instead of a null logger

### 2.1.0

- New releases are picked up on **any** library scan, including the real-time monitor refresh when a folder appears - previously only the 6-hourly task or a full scan created `.strm` files
- `.strm` files created during a scan are injected into that scan, so the item shows up immediately
- Library refresh after creating `.strm` files is now done in-process (`ILibraryMonitor`) instead of an unauthenticated HTTP call that always failed ("Jellyfin API not accessible")
- STRM creation logic de-duplicated into `StrmFileHelper`; `.part2.rar`+ volumes are skipped

### 2.0.0

- **Simplified to STRM-only mode** - removed rar2fs/FUSE mounting code
- No Docker privileges required (no /dev/fuse, SYS_ADMIN, apparmor)
- Unified installation for Windows and Linux (just copy DLLs)
- Removed dependencies: rar2fs, FUSE, custom init scripts

### 1.1.0

- Windows support tested and documented
- Auto-update `.strm` files when RAR archives are moved
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned `.strm` files

### 1.0.0

- Initial release
- Multi-part archive support
- Configuration UI
